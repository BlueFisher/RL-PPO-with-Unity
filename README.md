# RL-with-Unity
The implementation of many reinforcement learning algorithms based on the Unity3d environment.

We use [ml-agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) to connect Unity game environment with learning algorithm based on python runtime. In the training and inference stage, we use [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) to build our neural network.

For now, we have implemented DDPG, DQN, PPO to solve [a simple roller game](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Create-New.md).
