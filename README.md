# RL-PPO-with-Unity
The implementation of PPO algorithm based on the Unity3d environment.

We use [ml-agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) to connect Unity game environment with learning algorithm based on python runtime. In the training and inference stage, we use [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) to build our neural network.
